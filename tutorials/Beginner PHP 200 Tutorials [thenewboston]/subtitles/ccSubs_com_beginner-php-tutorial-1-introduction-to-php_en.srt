hi this is alex from PHP academy&#39; dog
and this is a PHP video tutorial for the

3
00:00:05 --> 00:00:10
new boston now in this video I&#39;m simply
going to talk to you about what PHP is

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:16
and why you should use it and a little
bit of information about what websites

5
00:00:16 --> 00:00:17
do you use it

6
00:00:17 --> 00:00:21
so the first thing about PHP is what it
stands for PHP stands for hypertext

7
00:00:21 --> 00:00:25
preprocessor in fact the first p is p

8
00:00:25 --> 00:00:29
so it&#39;s PHP hypertext preprocessor
that&#39;s what it stands for

9
00:00:29 --> 00:00:33
so we&#39;ve got to a recursive acronym
because we have an acronym inside of

10
00:00:33 --> 00:00:38
them inside another acronym because of
it originally PHP stood for personal

11
00:00:38 --> 00:00:43
home page is now being changed to stand
for PHP hypertext preprocessor with the

12
00:00:43 --> 00:00:47
PHP inside of that still standing for
personal homepage

13
00:00:47 --> 00:00:54
so what is PHP and why should we use it
what PHP is a server-side scripting

14
00:00:54 --> 00:00:54
language

15
00:00:54 --> 00:01:00
now when you open up a here PHP file and
you type in the code and it&#39;s not

16
00:01:00 --> 00:01:04
available to view by the user of the
website they cannot right click and see

17
00:01:04 --> 00:01:04
your code

18
00:01:04 --> 00:01:11
so it&#39;s not like HTML with HTML being a
markup language is interpreted by the

19
00:01:11 --> 00:01:16
browser now PHP and the code inside of
it is interpreted by the web server and

20
00:01:16 --> 00:01:21
compiled server side and then the output
of the of the application if you like is

21
00:01:21 --> 00:01:24
displayed in HTML if we choose to do so

22
00:01:24 --> 00:01:32
so it&#39;s basically used to create dynamic
content on web sites so we&#39;re not with

23
00:01:32 --> 00:01:37
we were essentially creating a program
within a website so we&#39;ll bring it being

24
00:01:37 --> 00:01:39
able to do a variety of different things

25
00:01:39 --> 00:01:44
let&#39;s head over to the PHP official
website which is php.net so if you need

26
00:01:44 --> 00:01:47
any more information i&#39;m just giving you
a bright brief in

27
00:01:47 --> 00:01:53
overview here go over to php.net and you
can read some information about PHP as

28
00:01:53 --> 00:01:58
well as music etc etc etc so when we&#39;ve
got a little description about hear

29
00:01:58 --> 00:02:03
about what is PHP and we&#39;ve got an
introduction introductory tutorial now

30
00:02:03 --> 00:02:06
the great thing about PHP is while
you&#39;re developing it has a really

31
00:02:06 --> 00:02:11
extensive documentation to it and this
is called the manuals we&#39;ve got a link

32
00:02:11 --> 00:02:17
it to the manual and basically we&#39;ve got
an an online manual for lots of

33
00:02:17 --> 00:02:22
different languages and you can also
download the doc download documentation

34
00:02:22 --> 00:02:26
as well and what the manual do is we can
search in here for say function next

35
00:02:26 --> 00:02:30
for example we might search for F open
in the functions left and we see now it

36
00:02:30 --> 00:02:30
returns

37
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
I some information about our function so
we can now go down and look at the

38
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
different parameters of the arguments it
takes

39
00:02:35 --> 00:02:39
we can also look at some examples down
here so it&#39;s a really extensive list you

40
00:02:39 --> 00:02:44
can save user submitted and examples as
well so you can get a really great feel

41
00:02:44 --> 00:02:49
of different functions and not just
functions but everything inside PHP from

42
00:02:49 --> 00:02:50
this PHP manual

43
00:02:50 --> 00:02:55
so what kind of websites use PHP and why
do they use it on Facebook for example

44
00:02:55 --> 00:02:59
use PHP what we&#39;re doing is with with
facebook is a social networking website

45
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
they&#39;re storing lots of data in a
database

46
00:03:01 --> 00:03:05
so what we can do with PHP is we combine
PHP with a database system and we

47
00:03:05 --> 00:03:09
typically do this with mysql and
inserting them in the two tourists I

48
00:03:09 --> 00:03:14
create I use mysql and my skewers one of
the widely is used and powerful and

49
00:03:14 --> 00:03:16
fastest databases around

50
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
so when my skewers great to use with pH
pay for storing data

51
00:03:19 --> 00:03:23
so Facebook is one of the social
networking websites that takes advantage

52
00:03:23 --> 00:03:30
of PHP as a whole as it&#39;s a really
really nice language to work with a lot

53
00:03:30 --> 00:03:35
of the syntax and structure similar to
see and it sent it actually interpreted

54
00:03:35 --> 00:03:38
by C server side as well I think it&#39;s
COC

55
00:03:38 --> 00:03:42
you yeah probably see but you can
obviously prove me wrong like if you

56
00:03:42 --> 00:03:43
like a home

57
00:03:43 --> 00:03:47
I may be wrong but yeah this is a brief
overview overview of PHP so if you&#39;re

58
00:03:47 --> 00:03:49
thinking about getting started dinner

59
00:03:49 --> 00:03:54
follow the tutorial is I&#39;ve created and
you can begin to start creating dynamic

60
00:03:54 --> 00:03:58
websites and you actually start to
realize how easy PHP is the fundamentals

61
00:03:58 --> 00:04:02
of it anyway we can start going in to
solve the object oriented programming

62
00:04:02 --> 00:04:06
side of PHP which is slightly more
difficult because some people struggle

63
00:04:06 --> 00:04:10
with object-oriented programming so we
do have the object oriented programming

64
00:04:10 --> 00:04:17
functionality within PHP and this was
added from PHP version 5 I believe in

65
00:04:17 --> 00:04:22
about two thousand four so we can use
object oriented programming inside PHP

66
00:04:22 --> 00:04:30
as well as recursive sorry not recursive
and procedural programming as well so

67
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
it&#39;s procedural structure to our code

68
00:04:33 --> 00:04:37
so that&#39;s a brief overview overview of
PHP and its really really great language

69
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
to learn and its really really widely
used on the web today so it&#39;s definitely

70
00:04:40 --> 00:04:41
worth it
